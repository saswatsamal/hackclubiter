<h1 align="center">Hack Club ITER</h1>
<p align="center">Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower—turning you from a consumer of technology into a creator. So it shouldn’t be taught like a class—it should be a creative, inclusive space. To foster this environment, every Hack Club is student-led & members make self-directed projects.</p>
